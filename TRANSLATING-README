0. Fork on GitHub

1. Create a new directory for the translated HTML files

Use the language code as you would find it in the locale.

Most of the the links shouldn't have a problem resolving so they
find the images and stylesheets.

2. Translate stuff

Don't wait until you have everything translated. You do a little 
and someone else does a little.

3. Send a pull request

*. Get free flag icons from: http://www.freeflagicons.com

You don't have to mess with the flags though. Focus on the 
translation first.
